Write a program to calculate Fibonacci numbers.
• Display the program title and programmer’s name. Then get the user’s name, and greet the user.
• Prompt the user to enter the number of Fibonacci terms to be displayed. Advise the user to enter an integer in the range [1 .. 46].
• Get and validate the user input (n).
• Calculate and display all of the Fibonacci numbers up to and including the nth term. The results should be displayed 5 terms per line with at least 5 spaces between terms.
• Display a parting message that includes the user’s name, and terminate the program.
